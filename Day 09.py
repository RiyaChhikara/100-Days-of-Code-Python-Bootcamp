# Grading Program-------------------------------------------------
'''
You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
This is the scoring criteria:

Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

## Exercise: 
'''
You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.

add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
You've visited Russia 2 times.

You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.'''
