----------------------------------- Basics of Internet ---------------------------------------
Client - computer used by the user
Web Server - A giant library. they serve data to interact with websites. example- Google Server
ISP - Internet Service Provider. The client sends a message to this ISP. example- I want to see Google.
DNS- Domain Name System. like a phonebook searches for the IP address of Google.

----------------------------------- How do websites work -------------------------------------
Three types of files:
HTML - Responsible for the structure. Like an architect, adding buttons
CSS - Styling the website. Like painters, and decorators. How the website looks. Example- font, button colour
JS - Adds functions to the website. Like an electrician, a plumber who does things, adds behaviour.

-------------------------------------------- HTML ---------------------------------------------
HyperText Markup Language 
example - <a>, <body>, <br>
Heading element- <h1> Hello World </h1> . They are up to h6.
Tags- Inside angle brackets. The one with a forward slash is a closing tag 
Element- entire content between the tags + opening or closing tag 
Paragraph elements- <p> This is a paragraph </p>
Void elements- No content inside the tag. <hr/> is the horizontal rule element. 
              - break element <br/> so that we don't have all content in one line.

<p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised
    during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic
    Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion
    to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-century critic
    Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was
    placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except
    for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the
    imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]</p>

<p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later
    critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His
    paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has
    been said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who was hostile to
    the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and
    ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he
    maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as
    Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify.
    The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not
    forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable
    successors".[14]
